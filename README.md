## What is the project about?

This is a website which generates recipes using food items within your kitchen. It allows you to input all ingredients and then performs a search and outputs any ingredients the user may cook with those ingredients. There is a minimum of 3 food items that should be inputted before a search is complete.

## Tools used

## Running the project

Runs on terminal/command line when the user inputs

```shell
npm start
```

Is loaded onto a browser when the user types

```shell
localhost:8080
```

## Testing

We have a testing framework which we have adapted to our project. We are using Jest in order to test our code. It works using ``` npm run test.only ```
We chose to use test.only as npm run test loads localhost:8080. We also plan to use actions to automate the running of tests further in the project.
